# Ambassador

This is a Velocity plugin that makes it possible to host a modern Forge server behind a Velocity proxy!

Unlike other solutions, this plugin does not require any special modifications to the backend server nor the client. (The player doesn't need to do anything)
## Only for 1.13-1.20.1
Velocity has now added built-in support for newer mc versions and therefore don't need Ambassador. You might still need PCF mod on the server-side, for more info please visit: https://github.com/adde0109/Proxy-Compatible-Forge
## How to get started:
1. Download and install this plugin to your proxy.
2. After starting the server, configure the plugin it to your liking using the config file found in the folder "Ambassador".
3. If you want to use player-information forwarding you can use any of these mods on the 1.13+ forge server:
- https://github.com/adde0109/Proxy-Compatible-Forge (Modern forwarding) (Magma 1.18.2 and higher includes this)

- https://github.com/caunt/BungeeForge (Legacy forwarding)

## Features
* Server switching without any client side mod when the servers are similar. (Mods must match)
* ServerRedirect support for server switching.
* Server switching using Client Reset Packet Mod for instant server switching:
  
1.16.5: https://github.com/Just-Chaldea/Forge-Client-Reset-Packet

1.18.2+: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forge-client-reset-packet-forward

## Stuck on "Negotiating":
This is an issue with Client Reset Packet Mod being partly incompatible with certain mods on the client. Please remove incompatible mods on the client if you have this issue. (Yes, this also includes client-side only mods.)
